# SteelQuiz
## A quiz program designed to make learning easier  

Tired of practising vocabulary/sets of questions in the traditional way, or with software/websites that ask the same questions over and over? Then you should take a look at SteelQuiz. SteelQuiz picks questions to ask based on what you have already learned and what not. Thus, the process of learning will be much faster - increasing your effectivity and saving your time for things you like to do.

### Intelligent Learning
SteelQuiz contains a feature called _**Intelligent Learning**_, which speeds up the learning process. Questions you already know the answer to with certainty, won't be asked as much as those you are unsure about. **This system activates after two rounds by default**, as it needs to gather some information first, before it can begin sorting out questions.
   
### Smart Comparison
Did you accidentally capitalize the first character of the answer? Did you put a dot in the end, that the stored quiz answer doesn't contain? No worries - SteelQuiz will ignore these minor differences along with others - as long as it is enabled for the quiz you are doing.
   
### Dark Mode Support
SteelQuiz has a built-in light theme and dark theme - select the one that suits you best. It can also sync the theme with Windows 10.
   
### Quiz Import/Export Support
You can import quizzes to SteelQuiz, from other sources that supports text exportation. And vice versa - SteelQuiz also supports quiz exportation.
   
### Sync your data across different computers
SteelQuiz can store your user data on your preferred cloud storage provider - syncing your progress and quizzes across multiple devices.
   
### Quiz Editor
You can create and edit quizzes, with the built in quiz editor. It has full support for undo/redo, provides support for adding synonyms to words, and automatically creates recovery saves for your project in case SteelQuiz exits unexpectedly before you save.

### Automatic Updates
SteelQuiz automatically downloads and installs updates, offers to download them, or neither, depending on your preferences. It is recommended to always install all available updates, as they often contain important bug fixes and improvements.

### Additional notes
- The portable version (and the installed version) saves user data (config, quizzes, quiz progress etc.) in _%appdata%\SteelQuiz_.
- The uninstaller does not remove user data.

### Incompatible Software
- **f.lux Microsoft Store version**   
Causes problems with installation, updates, and uninstallation of SteelQuiz. The specific cause of the problem is currently unknown. For some reason, it causes System PID 4 to lock SteelQuiz.exe.   
**Solution:** Uninstall the f.lux Microsoft Store version, and install the non-Store version of f.lux instead (the one you download from their website).
