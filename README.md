# SteelQuiz
## A quiz program designed to make learning words easier
   
Tired of practising vocabulary in the traditional way, or with software/websites that ask the same questions over and over? Then you should take a look at SteelQuiz. SteelQuiz contains a feature (optional) which selects the words to ask based on what you know. Words you already know won't be asked as much as words you are a bit more unsure about.

SteelQuiz is still in pre-release phase, so expect some bugs and issues.
