# SteelQuiz
## A quiz program designed to make learning words easier
   
Tired of practising vocabulary in the traditional way, or with software/websites that ask the same questions over and over? Then you should take a look at SteelQuiz. SteelQuiz contains a feature (optional) which selects the words to ask based on what you know. Words you already know won't be asked as much as words you are a bit more unsure about.

SteelQuiz is still in pre-release phase, so expect some bugs and issues.

### Intelligent Learning
SteelQuiz contains a feature called _**Intelligent Learning**_, which speeds up the learning process. Words you already know won't be asked as much as words you are unsure about. **This system activates after two rounds**, as it needs to gather some information first, before it can begin sorting out words. To disable Intelligent Learning, just click on the disable button while practising the quiz.

### Quiz Editor
You can create and edit quizzes, with the built in quiz editor. It has full support for undo/redo, provides support for adding synonyms to words, and automatically creates recovery saves for your project in case SteelQuiz exits unexpectedly before you save.

### Fix quiz problems quickly and easily
Is there a spelling error in the quiz? Or do you want to add a synonym to a word? No problem - just click "Fix quiz errors" while practising, and change the quiz as you like. It only takes a few seconds.

### Automatic updates
SteelQuiz automatically searches for, and offers to download and install updates. You only need to click one button to update. It is recommended to always install all available updates, as they often contain important bug fixes and improvements.
