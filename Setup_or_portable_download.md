# Should I "Download Setup" or "Download Portable"?
### If you are unsure - choose *Download Setup*
&NewLine;\
**Download Setup** if you want to install the program. Administrator privileges are not required.\
&NewLine;\
**Download Portable** to get all program files in a ZIP archive - no installation needed. Do so if any of the following statements are true:
- you will put the program on a USB stick for usage across multiple PCs
- you intend to keep the program for a very short time
- you generally dislike installing software
